    "The problem that I chose to work on is the potential inside of a rectangular pipe where it has three grounded sides and a side at x = +b that has a potential of $V_0(y)$. This problem was inspiried by the \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\" by David J. Griffiths problem set. Specifically problen 3.15. The original problem is as follows:\n",

    "We must first start with Laplace's equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2V(x,y,z) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying separation of variables we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging this into Laplace's equation we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{X}\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} + \\frac{1}{Y}\\frac{d^2Y}{dy^2} + \\frac{1}{Z}\\frac{d^2Z}{dz^2} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in class this equation implies that each term must be equal to a constant that all add up to zero. This gives us the following three equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(x) = Ae^{kx} + Be^{-kx}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our general solution but we can simplify it further. Specifically in this problem we do not have any dependence on the z variable. This means that we can set k3 = 0 and remove the Z(z) term from our solution. Additionally we would expect the x direction to decay exponentially from its $V_0(y)$ and for the y direction to only have a sinusodial dependence. This leaves us with the following solution:\n",

    "3. Knowing V(x = 0) = 0 we can say: $X(x = 0) = Ae^{kx} + Be^{-kx} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> This implies that A = -B\n",
