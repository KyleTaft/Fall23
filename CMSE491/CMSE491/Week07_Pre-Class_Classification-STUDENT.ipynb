    "## Goals for this Pre-Class Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This Pre-Class assignment is a bit different in that you will work with your team. Think of this much more as a team-based pre-class (PC) assignment. Contact your team members now to ensure that you have a communication link, if you have not already done so. It would be extremely beneficial if you plan to meet with your group members outside of class at least twice before the IC next Monday. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you will turn in is this notebook as part of your PCA and your presentation as PDF slides as part of the ICA in D2L. Be sure to have all of your team members have their name on those slides, and who did what, so that everyone gets the proper credit. They are due at the end of class on Monday, and you will have a few minutes to finalize them once you get to class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Total number of points: **30 points**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This assignment is due by 11:59 p.m. the day before class,** and should be uploaded into the appropriate \"Pre-Class Assignments\" submission folder on D2L.  Submission instructions can be found at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MNIST Contest: Best Classifier Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The class is going to have a contest to see who can get the most accurate classifier for the two MNIST datasets. This is **not** a contest between students, nor is it a contest between groups per se. It is a contest of the ML workflow and the different algorithms. Your final product will be a presentation to the class next Monday. Your team will present a set of slides to the class describing your results. <font color='red'>**Each group has five to ten minutes for their presentation!!**</font>  _It is extremely important that you do not go over your time._ Conversely, you are graded on your content, so do not plan to go much under five minutes either. If you need to practice to get the timing right, please do that. This is the way the real world works, so use this oppportunity to learn how to get a lot of information across quickly and coherently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start the presentations at 4:00pm, so plan to come to the In class next Monday ready to finalize your plots, practice your talk, tweak your slides, whatever your group needs. Be sure that you are able to connect to the projector; make sure the slides are on a laptop with, say, an HDMI port. Be prepared to ask questions to the speakers. If everyone has a working presentation we may start early to give more time for discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contest Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group can pick any classifiers it wants. You can pick one or many; be sure to give yourself enough time if you pick  many. The goal is to optimize those classifiers to get the most accurate results on both MNIST datasets. The \"winner\" is the overall algorithm that, when used in the same way on both, gets the most accurate result, defined as the average of the two scores from each MNIST datasets. Below I'll go into what I mean by \"score\", since that is subtle for classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might:\n",
    "* Choose SGDClassifer because it is simple, you know how to use it, and there are many options. \n",
    "* Perform feature selection.\n",
    "* Perform CV and learning curves.\n",
    "* Regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you might:\n",
    "* Pick MLP, since you know them, but _also_ SVCs because you'll be ahead when we get there and you'll have an interesting way to know what architecture MLP needs to get good results. \n",
    "* Focus on the nuances of those two methods (e.g., width/depth/activation, kernels) to see which is best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you might:\n",
    "* Pick just MLP, since you know them and they are very flexible. \n",
    "* Focus on the many ways to optimize MLPs (e.g., varying activcation functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you might:\n",
    "* Pick several methods, because one way to win is to have an internal contest first!! This also makes working with your group easier because you can assign one classifier to each person and put the comparisons together for the presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you might:\n",
    "* Focus on those things your group will use in their projects, such as a Keras/TensorFlow approach. If you are using CNNs for your project this is a great time to practice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You get the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Be very organized: your group has three people in it, so be sure to divide and conquer, communicate well, meet in person and don't wait too long_. You have 20 minutes once you get to class to get your final presentation in order and make sure it works on the projector - show up early if you need to. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "You should include:\n",
    "* What ML algorithm(s) you used, and why.\n",
    "* What the **baseline** results are for these methods, with **no** tweaking.\n",
    "* Discussion of all of the improvements you made to these algorithms through hyperparameter tuning, scaling, selection and so on. Show plots for every case to back up what you did.\n",
    "* Show a diagram of your proposed ML workflow. Because this is classification, be sure to use as many new tools as you can (see below).\n",
    "* Show your final result which is the average of the best two scores from both MNIST datasets using that same workflow. Don't tune the workflow to the two datasets separately: we are looking for transferability - the ability for a workflow on one dataset to also work on another.\n",
    "* It is very important that you use the new techniques we are learning this week that are classifier specific (e.g., confusion matrices).\n"

Because both MNISTs have ten features we can pick just one feature and see if your algorithm(s) can find that one from the others.
