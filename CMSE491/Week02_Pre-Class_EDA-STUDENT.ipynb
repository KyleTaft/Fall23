    "3. The data comes from a .csv file. Looking at housing.info() it seems that it was all read in correctly as floats except for ocean_proximity. If we want to use ocean_proximity as a feature, we will have to convert it to a number.\n",

If not, I would probably remove the capped data from the dataset if it is not necessary for the model.\n",

This is into a 20% testing set and 80% training set. The author uses StratifiedShuffleSplit which is a cross validation method.\n",

    "5. This allows us to fill in missing values with, in this case, the median of the feature. This is useful because we want to preserve the data when we can instead of just removing it. This is a simple method of doing this compared to methods such as KNN imputation."
